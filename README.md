# A06: Alias

In this assignment, you will be implementing the realtime functionality for Alias - a casual chatting app based off of [Discord](https://discord.com)! Users can log in / sign up, join or create servers, send messages and images, and add reactions. As users in the same server / channel perform these actions, all other users get immediately notified and the UI updates in realtime.

The app itself is built using Next.js and will be deployed live to the internet via Vercel. This is a rather large application! The UI and many of the helper functions have been set up for you. The completed code that we worked on for you also can serve as a good guide as an example for how you might want to set up / organize your final project. The app itself will be built using Next.js, deployed live to the internet via Vercel.

You will complete this project with a partner. **IMPORTANT: Only one member** needs to submit to GradeScope - make sure that both partners are listed in the submission!
